            <p class="para1"> Hello! My name is Michelle and I was born and raised in Melbourne. My parents immigrated from China a few years before I was born, looking for a better life. Here, they opened a Charcoal Chicken Shop and Noodle Bar which they still run to this day! I also have two little sisters (one pictured with me on the right). After graduating university, I met my wonderful fiance and we decided to try running our own business. We chose a Fish and chip shop in Sunbury and moved there to start a new chapter. We recently sold our shop after two long years and I'm now looking towards a career in IT!

            <h2 class="subheading">Hobbies/Interests</h2>

            <p class="para2"> I used to spend an unhealthy amount of time on my computer playing games (hence the interest in computers and IT!) but outside my addiction, I love going for hikes in the mountains and walks along beaches. I am also a coffee addict and love looking for new cafes to explore. I am more of a homebody and  with my spare time I make cakes! Have a look at my blog <a class="readlink" href="bloghome.html">here</a> to see my latest creations &#128516;.
