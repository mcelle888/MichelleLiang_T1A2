            <p class="para1"> I completed high school in 2014 at St Monica's College. Shortly after, I studied a year and a half of Arts majoring in creative writing. However concerned about my job prospects for the future, I ultimately chose to switch to a Commerce degree. I graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor of Commerce (Finance and Accounting) in 2020. Currently, I'm a student studying IT and Coder Academy. <br> <br>

            <h2 class="subheading">Work</h2>
            <p class="para1"> Most recently, my partner and I bought a Fresh Seafood/Fish and Chips shop in Sunbury which we operated for 2 years. It was a decision made to challenge ourselves and throughout the experience we learnt a great deal on how to operate a small business. This allowed us to improve our communication skills, our ability to manage finances, manage staff and work under pressure. It was a rough experience but at the same time an experience I'm grateful for as it really accelerated my personal development.
